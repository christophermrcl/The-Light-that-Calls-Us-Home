## 🔴About
You are a high school student suddenly transported to another world along with your friend. The two of you find yourselves at an ancient, abandoned altar where you are bestowed with the powers of a magic swordsman. Eager to return home, you set out to gather information from a nearby village. The villagers speak of an ancient legend, one that tells of a portal to another world. Determined to find your way back, you embark on a perilous journey, overcoming countless obstacles along the way.

Solve intricate puzzles, battle fierce foes, and challenge the final boss to reclaim your path home. Your fate lies in overcoming these trials, for only then can you return to the world from whence you came.
